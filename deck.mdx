# :wave:

<Notes>Alright, thats enough about me. Now, lets get this party started</Notes>

---

Consider this:

```jsx
<Page user={user} avatarSize={avatarSize} />
// ... which renders ...
<PageLayout user={user} avatarSize={avatarSize} />
// ... which renders ...
<NavigationBar user={user} avatarSize={avatarSize} />
// ... which renders ...
<Link href={user.permalink}>
  <Avatar user={user} size={avatarSize} />
</Link>
```

<Notes>
  Lets analyse this component tree together: Good: - Components split up
  logically with all the props getting passed down explicitly - Can trace the
  flow of data for debugging - This is the accepted react way of doing things in
  most cases Bad: - Intermediary components have to act as prop messengers -
  Refactoring is hard when nesting gets too deep
</Notes>

### Problems :cold_sweat:

- Intermediary components have to act as prop messengers
- Refactoring is hard when nesting gets too deep

Commonly referred as "Prop drilling"
(Shout out to Kent Dodds :tada:)

---

## Solution ? :rocket:

---

## Component composition to the rescue ! :rocket:

<Notes> (if you all thought i was gonna say context, hold your horses) </Notes>

---

### Component Composition

```jsx
function Page(props) {
  const user = props.user;
  const userLink = (
    <Link href={user.permalink}>
      <Avatar user={user} size={props.avatarSize} />
    </Link>
  );
  return <PageLayout userLink={userLink} />;
}
<Page user={user} avatarSize={avatarSize} />
// ... which renders ...
<PageLayout userLink={...} />
// ... which renders ...
<NavigationBar userLink={...} />
// ... which renders ...
{props.userLink}
```

<Notes>
  - We are passing the whole component down as prop here. - Refactoring the
  nested component is easy now because we just make changes at the parent level.
  Don't have to worry about changing the props in all the components But,
  downside is that it increases the complexity of the parent component.
</Notes>

## Multiple Children - Slots

```jsx
function Page(props) {
  const user = props.user;
  const content = <Feed user={user} />;
  const topBar = (
    <NavigationBar>
      <Link href={user.permalink}>
        <Avatar user={user} size={props.avatarSize} />
      </Link>
    </NavigationBar>
  );
  return <PageLayout topBar={topBar} content={content} />;
}
```

---

Hang on..umm.. I was told this is a talk on React Context :confused:

<Notes>
  Well, We may have solved the prop drilling problem for this particular
  subtree(local data). But what if we need to share data between different parts
  of component tree with different nesting levels? Broadcast data?
</Notes>

---

## Context API :fire:

<Notes>What is Context API?</Notes>

---

# What is Context API?

<blockquote>
  Context provides a way to pass "global" data down a component subtree without
  (explicitly)passing props down 
</blockquote>
Ex: currentUser, theme, locale etc

<Notes>
  Values like currentUser, theme, locale etc are required by multiple components
  throughout the app and context provides a way to share values like these
  between different components without having to explicitly pass down props
</Notes>

---

# Evolution of Context API

```
Legacy API  ->  New stable API(16.3) -> React 16.6  -> Hooks(16.8)
                (Provider, Consumer)    (contextType)  (useContext)

```

---

## Syntax of Context API

createContext

```jsx
export const ThemeContext = React.createContext({ theme: 'dark' });
```

Provider

```jsx
<ThemeContext.Provider value={value}>{children}</ThemeContext.Provider>
```

---

Consumer

contextType(class component)

```jsx
import { ThemeContext } from './theme-context.js';

class Layout extends React.Component {
  static contextType = ThemeContext;
  render() {
    let value = this.context;
    /* render something based on the value of ThemeContext */
  }
}
```

---

Consumer

useContext(functional component)

```jsx
import { ThemeContext } from './theme-context.js';

function ThemeButton() {
  const context = React.useContext(ThemeContext);
  const { theme, toggleTheme } = context;
  return (...);
}
```

---

### EXAMPLE:

theme-context.js

```jsx
export const ThemeContext = React.createContext({
  theme: themes.dark,
  toggleTheme: () => {}
});
```

---

app.js

```jsx
class App extends React.Component {
  toggleTheme = () => { ... }
  render() {
    const value = React.useMemo(() => {
    return {
      theme: themes.light,
      toggleTheme: this.toggleTheme
    }
  }, [theme])
    return (
      <ThemeContext.Provider
        value={value}
      >
        <Content />
      </ThemeContext.Provider>
    );
  }
}
```

---

content.js

```jsx
import React from 'react';
import {ThemeButton} from './theme-button.js';
function Content() {
  return(
    <div><ThemeButton></div>
  )
}
```

---

theme-button.js

```jsx
import React from 'react';
import { ThemeContext } from './theme-context.js';

function ThemeButton() {
  const context = React.useContext(ThemeContext);
  const { theme, toggleTheme } = context;
  return (
    <button onClick={toggleTheme} style={{ bgColor: theme.bg }}>
      Toggle Theme
    </button>
  );
}
```

---

### Deep Prop drilling problem solved by Context ! Yaayyy! :tada:

---

## Caveat - Performance Issue with value

```jsx
<Context.Provider value={{ something: 'something' }}>
  <Toolbar />
</Context.Provider>
```

Note: Everytime Provider re-renders, all of its Consumers re-render as well.

<Notes>Unnecessary rerender </Notes>

---

### Pick the right approach: Composition or Context :key:

---

### Does Context replace redux: The burning question :fire:

Self introspection time

Why do I use redux in my app?

---

### Redux provides

- time-travel debugging
- Middleware
- Devtools
- ReactRedux has connect() -> solves prop drilling
- List goes on ..

---

If your answer was connect(), then yes Context replaces Redux :thumbsup:

But if you need and use any of the other Redux features, then NOOO !

<Notes> Refer Mark Erikson's blog for details </Notes>

---

Summary :rocket:

- Our job as developers doesn't end with just picking the right library/framework
- Every decision like which API to use, which pattern to follow etc adds up
- They determine our app's performance, code quality, maintainability etc
- So choose between Composition/ Context / Redux wisely :thumbsup:
